## Authorization.

You must manually enter the OAuth2 token in the JOSM settings. 
1. `Edit`->`Preferences`->`Expert Mode`
2. `OSM Server`->`Authorize now (Manual)`

## Usage 

Offline mode is enabled by default for josm.openstreetmap.de Due to the limitations of CORS, access to it is limited, so you must first install and enable [this extension](https://webextension.org/listing/access-control.html). Only then can you disable offline mode.
